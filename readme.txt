Generates not one but two, highly customizable Google News Editors’ Picks RSS Feeds.

== Description ==

The most comprehensive RSS feed generator specifically tailored to meet the needs of publishers wanting to optimize an individual Google News Editors’ Picks RSS Feed. Creates both a homepage and section-based feed topic-specific. 
Customize required feed images, names, titles, descriptions and more! Exclude articles from feeds and enter custom meta descriptions from the lightweight, custom meta box located on post.php (edit) screens.
In order to have your website included in Google News, you will have to [suggest it for inclusion](https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/40787?hl=en) first. This plugin is nearly pointless without site inclusion.
Serious news sites should consider upgrading to the WordPress Google News Plugin (http://www.googlenewsplugin.com) to take advantage of all tools available to Google News Publishers and optimize their site for Google News.

Some features:

* Set default values and customize RSS feeds
* Add required image or logo to Google News Editors’ Picks RSS Feeds
* Exclude articles from the feeds
* Include standout tag for standout content
* Ping Webmaster Tools when feeds are updated with smart ping technology
* Submit and set Editors’ pick feed

= Multi-Site Compatible =
This plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The feeds work in the Network settings and you can copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.
